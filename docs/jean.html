  <h1>Jean Adrien Claire Mesritz</h1>

  <p>Jean Claire Adrien Mesritz (The Hague, 2 March 1918 â€“ Neuengamme,
  31 March 1945) was a Dutch Resistance Fighter during World War
  II. He was the elder brother of Denis Mesritz.

  <p>At the outbreak of the war, Mesritz was a student at Leiden
  University, a member of the Student Corps and a junior commissioned
  officer (Kornet) in the Mounted Artillery. On 13 August 1940, he
  tried to hijack the Scheveningen logger SCH 107 to sail to England,
  along with Erik Michielsen and Carel Kranenburg. This plan failed
  because the ship had already been requisitioned by the Germans.

  <p>He then arranged to be picked up on the Tjeukemeer in Friesland
  by an RAF seaplane on 13 October, with Marion Smit, Hans Hers,
  Lodewijk van Hamel and Lourens Baas Becking. The plane was from the
  320 Dutch Squadron RAF commanded by Heije Schaper. This attempt was
  foiled by fog.

  <p>On the second attempt on 15 October, the aircraft was shelled on
  the water by German anti-aircraft guns. The plane managed to take
  off again and escape, but the resistance fighters were arrested and
  transferred to the detention center in Leeuwarden, and from there to
  the Oranjehotel (a Nazi prison in Amsterdam). They were tried in
  April 1941. Van Hamel was sentenced to death, and Hers to
  life. Mesritz was sentenced to three years in prison.

  <p>On the day he was scheduled to be released he was told that he
    was now in protective custody, and stayed in custody until his
    death. On 5 June 1943, Mesritz was transferred to the Vught
    concentration camp, where he met Professor Cleveringa, with whom
    he was imprisoned in the Oranjehotel, and is able to help him a
    little.

  <p>Eventually he ended up in Neuengamme concentration camp where he
  worked in the horse stables. There he died on 31 March 1945.


    <p>In the film Soldier of Orange, Jan Weinberg (played by Huib
    Rooymans) is based on Jean Mesritz.   Contrary to reality, he is shot in the film.
